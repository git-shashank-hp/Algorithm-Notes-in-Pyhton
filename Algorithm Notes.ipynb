    "# Linear Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element in a list or array sequentially until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "1. **Start at the Beginning**: Begin at the first element of the list.\n",
    "2. **Compare Each Element**: Compare the current element with the target value.\n",
    "3. **Continue Until Found or End**: \n",
    "   - If the current element matches the target, return its index.\n",
    "   - If it doesn’t match, move to the next element. Repeat until the target is found or the list ends.\n",
    "4. **Return Result**: \n",
    "   - If the target is found, return its index.\n",
    "   - If not, return a special value (often -1) indicating the target is not in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "- **Best Case**: O(1) (when the element is the first one)\n",
    "- **Worst Case**: O(n) (when the element is at the end or not present)\n",
    "- **Average Case**: O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity\n",
    "- O(1) (only a constant amount of extra space is used)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "For an array `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, if you want to find `30`:\n",
    "1. Compare `10` (not a match).\n",
    "2. Compare `20` (not a match).\n",
    "3. Compare `30` (match found at index 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "- Simple and effective for small or unsorted datasets.\n",
    "- When the list is small, the overhead of more complex algorithms (like binary search) is unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Linear search is a straightforward method, suitable for certain scenarios, but may not be the most efficient choice for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithm Complexity Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing algorithms, we consider three primary scenarios to describe their performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Best-Case Scenario (Ω)\n",
    "- **Definition**: The best-case scenario describes the minimum time or space an algorithm will take to complete. It reflects the most favorable conditions for the algorithm.\n",
    "- **Example**: In a linear search, the best case occurs when the target element is the first item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Worst-Case Scenario (Big-O)\n",
    "- **Definition**: The worst-case scenario denotes the maximum time or space an algorithm will take to complete. It reflects the least favorable conditions and provides an upper limit on performance.\n",
    "- **Example**: In a linear search, the worst case occurs when the target element is the last item in the list or not present at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Average-Case Scenario (Θ)\n",
    "- **Definition**: The average-case scenario estimates the expected time or space an algorithm will take over all possible inputs. It considers a typical input case, providing a more realistic performance measure.\n",
    "- **Example**: For a linear search, the average case assumes that the target element is equally likely to be found at any position in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- **Best Case (Ω)**: Minimum performance, most favorable input.\n",
    "- **Worst Case (Big-O)**: Maximum performance, least favorable input.\n",
    "- **Average Case (Θ)**: Expected performance over all inputs, reflecting typical conditions.\n"

    "### Binary Search: A Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a **sorted** array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, leading to a much faster search than linear search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with two pointers—`low` (beginning of the array) and `high` (end of the array).\n",
    "2. **Midpoint Calculation**: Calculate the middle index: `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n",
    "3. **Comparison**:\n",
    "   - If the element at `mid` is the target, the search is successful.\n",
    "   - If the target is smaller than the middle element, adjust the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.\n",
    "   - If the target is larger, adjust the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the target is found or the search interval is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), making it significantly faster than linear search (O(n)), especially for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the iterative version; O(log n) for the recursive version due to call stack usage.\n",
    "- **Precondition**: The array must be sorted prior to using binary search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications:\n",
    "- Commonly used in databases, search algorithms, and various data structures like binary search trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a fundamental algorithm that highlights the power of divide-and-conquer strategies in computer science.\n"
